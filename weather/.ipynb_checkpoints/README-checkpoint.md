# Weather Comparison: Seattle vs Copanhagen

> A brief description of what the project does and its purpose.

---

## Project Overview

The point of this project is to to compate Seattle's weather to Copanhagen's. I will be using data from
[NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND) to see if the two cities are similar or different. 

- **Objective:** Compare Seattle's weather with Copenhagen's to identify similarities and differences in rainfall and temperature patterns.
