# Inequality of Educational Opportunity in U.S. High Schools.

> This project addresses inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. The project will focus on average student performance on the ACT/SAT exams and see if there is a relationship between a student's performance and their socioeconomic background such as household income, unemployment, adult educational attainment, family structure, etc.

## Project Overview

Provide a short and concise overview of the project. Mention the problem it solves, the data used, and the key outcomes or findings.

- **Objective:** The main goal of this project is to figure out if a high school student's socioeconomic background impacts their performance in ACT/SAT exams. There are two datasets used for this project. Both can be found in the data folder. The EdGap data includes information about ACT/SAT scores for schools and also socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The school dataset consists of basic identifying information about schools like school name, state name, academic year, etc. The third dataset includes information about teachers in U.S. schools, I will use it to explore whether there is a relationship between the number of teachers at a school and how well students perform on the ACT or SAT exams.
  
- **Domain:** U.S. Education
- **Key Techniques:** (e.g., Regression, Classification, Clustering, NLP, Time Series)
